                  What are the defference between arrow function and regular function ?

                  <p>this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation. But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.
                    arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments (but you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args). 
                    If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the return keyword.                  
                    Last but not least, you can define methods using the arrow function syntax inside classes. Fat arrow methods bind this value to the class instance.                   
                    Anyhow the fat arrow method is invoked, this always equals the class instance, which is useful when the methods are used as callbacks.</p>

                  <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                    .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
                    .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                    .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.
